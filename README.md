## Git & GitHub Daily Practice Summary

Today I practiced core Git and GitHub workflows using the command line on CentOS.

### What I Did

* Initialized a new local Git repository using `git init`
* Renamed the default branch from `master` to `main`
* Created and tracked files using `git add`
* Made the first commit to establish repository history
* Connected the local repository to a remote GitHub repository
* Pushed code to GitHub using HTTPS authentication with a Personal Access Token
* Resolved the issue of pushing without an initial commit
* Created a new branch for updates and feature work
* Modified an existing file on the new branch
* Committed changes separately on the feature branch
* Pushed the new branch to GitHub
* Merged the feature branch back into the `main` branch
* Pushed the merged changes to GitHub
* Learned safe branching and merging practices used in real-world development

### Key Learnings

* Git branches allow isolated development without affecting the main codebase
* A branch must have at least one commit before it can be pushed
* GitHub no longer supports password authentication; Personal Access Tokens are required
* Merging is always done from the target branch
* This workflow mirrors professional Git usage in teams

### Result

* Local and remote repositories are fully synchronized
* Changes are successfully merged into the main branch
* Strong foundation built in Git and GitHub fundamentals
